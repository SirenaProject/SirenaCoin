Our project for collective mining combines the goals and ideas of mutual benefit through mining using the firopou algorithm. The main goal of the project is to create decentralized nodes for storing various types of information. Transfers between wallets are carried out using S rings. The project does not have an explorer - which will allow you to maintain security and anonymity when transferring transactions, as well as when transferring information via a secure protocol.

However, you can create unofficial servers to communicate with each other
